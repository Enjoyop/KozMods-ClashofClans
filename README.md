# KozMods:entertainment only respect for commercial product
A great coc mod candidate for 15.292.8. Applicable for personal or pvp servers. I copied the predicted pattern. Even if this does come, it probably won't be in exactly the same pattern. This is just a fan content, it has nothing to do with supercell.
_I'm working on the client_...
